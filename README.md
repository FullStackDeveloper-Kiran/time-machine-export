# Time Machine Control Panel

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/josetxu/pen/mdqamzb](https://codepen.io/josetxu/pen/mdqamzb).

An attempt to recreate the time machine from the 2002 film directed by Simon Wells (great-grandson of HG Wells). I wanted to add more things, like the rotating glass panels, but so much css animation slowed everything down, although I do want to add more small junk and some crank... in the future.
